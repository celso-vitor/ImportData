### Advanced Protein Sequence Assembly from Mass Spectrometry Data  
**Unlock Protein Sequences with Precision**

---

## Overview

**SequenceAssembler** is a powerful, yet user-friendly software meticulously designed to reconstruct complete protein sequences. By intelligently integrating peptide-spectrum matching (PSM) and de novo sequencing data from mass spectrometry, it transforms complex raw data into clear, actionable biological insights.

Our intuitive interface simplifies the visualization and analysis of proteomics data. SequenceAssembler clearly differentiates peptide identifications — PSM in **green**, de novo in **yellow** — and illustrates the contribution of various enzymatic digestions to overall sequence coverage.

The **multi-template alignment view** allows for robust comparison against reference sequences, highlighting matches, mismatches, and experimentally covered regions — essential for accurate protein characterization and domain analysis (e.g., Albumin domains or antibody CDRs).

- Multi-template alignment for comparison against reference sequences
- Visual differentiation of data types:  
  - PSMs: **Green**  
  - De novo: **Yellow**
- Enzymatic digestion contribution mapping
- Domain-level analysis (e.g., CDRs, functional motifs)
- Designed for researchers in **shotgun proteomics**, **antibody profiling**, and **custom protein assembly**
